My name is <b>Bryl</b>ian Foronda. I was born in the Philippines and moved to Maui, Hawaii when I was eight. In 2009, I graduated with an A.S. degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology at the University of Hawaii - Maui College. Then in 2012, I graduated with a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering at University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently working full time as an IT Manager at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel and part-time as a Web Application Developer for RCUH. When I am not programming and implementing different application frameworks and server technologies, I am probably at playing Clash of Clans/Destiny, at the gym, or sleeping. 

This blog will mostly contain posts regarding IT, and maybe a little travel. Browse around and maybe you will learn a trick or two!
